# The fisherman is here (wearing a bright yellow raincoat which  is "a flash of familiar yellow" if you've seen the dog)
# He's worried because his dog jumped off the boat and he doesn't know where the dog is 
# and he can't leave his boat/catch to go looking for the dog
# He tells you the name of the dog
# When you return the dog, he gives you a fish you can use to tempt the cat down from the tree (if you don't already have a fish)
