# If you have an animal, you can bring it to check the microchip
# The microchip data gives clues as to who/where the owner is?
# In the waiting room is a crying girl (vet's daughter?) who has lost her rabbit
# If you have the rabbit you can return it (but you don't have to return it immediately)
# Else she can give you a hint that she last saw it near the field
# The vet can tell you that rabbits are really easily frightened
